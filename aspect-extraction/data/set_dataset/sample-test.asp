COURSE_A|0001
The lectures were very good and I learned a lot, however the professor was very condescending towards the students.	0 1
I did not feel like I could go to him for help.	0
I did however get all the help i needed from the peer mentors.	2

COURSE_B|0000
This course put a strong emphasis on the QFE credential, so when some students didn't get it, it sort of felt like the class was pointless from there on out.	1
As someone who applied and didn't get in, I felt like talking so much about QFE diminished what I was actually learning in the class and emphasized the class as only being useful for QFE candidates.	1
This was very demoralizing; prior to the decisions coming out I was very excited to take a financial economics course and was interested to see how I could apply what I was learning to my career.	1
Since a lot of economics classes are very theoretical, this class offers a unique chance for practical application in the department and I was disappointed to see how QFE overshadowed that.	1

COURSE_B|0001
Very rigorous and stressful with basically learning on your own.	3

COURSE_B|0002
Thank you, I enjoyed this course a lot and loved analyzing the different pieces of literature	3 1

COURSE_B|0003
The last section of the course (leading up to the final) felt really rushed and as if we went over a lot of materials.	4
It was kind of hard to follow, and as a result the homeworks have seemed harder	4 5

COURSE_B|0004
This course was much more helpful in encouraging students to grasp Latin concepts than 101 or 102.	3
The course materials definitely helped and improved my translation abilities.	1

COURSE_C|0000
I thought this course was very engaging and I liked that it was very hands on, like a lab should be.	3 6
