this class was one of the most enjoyable english classes i've taken at this school. I initially just took it for a gen ed not expecting it to be enjoyable but im glad to say i was wrong.	5
Good class gets you thinking about actual application of what we learn which in other economics courses isn't super common	4
Too much group work that didn't help. Good class and [NAME] is great but there are definitely lots that could be improved	3
I cannot say I would take this course again. There may be a large barrier to success, given that the information we must take away is quickly given and that, at times, I did not understand how some point may be contained in the texts we were assigned to read. I would feel much better about the course if our only course assignments were papers.	1

I enjoyed class time but struggled to keep up with the work load so it made class less productive, for me.	3
This course challenged me a lot. Coming into the course, I thought I was going to be taught, not have to teach myself. Class time is more for practice, which is helpful at time but not even you do not completely understand the material. When we learn difficult topics like pedigrees or nondisjunction we should spend more time going over the basic concept then diving into practice. Overall, I do not think the course was taught as an appropriate 101 course because it defiantly felt like a weed out class. I know Bio 101 is hard, but this course was very intense.	2
Really enjoyed this couse! Sabikne was a great instructor and I truly appreciate her as our professor. Learned a lot of new skills concerning videography. I just wish the class times were shorter	5
I really enjoyed this class!	5
