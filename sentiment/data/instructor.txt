Great guy, good teacher, but the tests are a bit on the long side. Didn't need to know the material as much as you needed to know how to manage time in order to finish questions also a very particular grader.	4
He is a fantastic professor that is extremely knowledgable in the subject	5
He obviously does not care about his students.  The worst professor I have had here.	1
Really enjoyed your teaching! I can't wait for [NAME]	5
I think [NAME] is a good guy and a good teacher.	4
I like [NAME], and I think he's an effective lecturer.	4
[NAME] is the man.  My only slight criticism is that he slips into telling stories pretty frequently which, while entertaining, don't ALWAYS add to the subject we're learning about (though they often do); this can be a slight annoyance when class runs over time (though, as I understand it, it didn't run over as frequently as it did last year).	4
[NAME] is a wonderful instructor. Office hours really helped me understand material even better. I respect the enthusiasm he demonstrated on the subject matter every day, and it improved the learning experience in the classroom. Thank you [NAME]	5
His review sessions really helped me out!	5
The class was very large so rather than getting a lot of one&ndash;on&ndash;one help with the professor, I communicated with him through emails (He was quick to respond) or I would go to office hours to talk with a TA. The TA's were very helpful and available to us. I went multiple times a week.	5
