This was very demoralizing; prior to the decisions coming out I was very excited to take a financial economics course and was interested to see how I could apply what I was learning to my career.	0

Very rigorous and stressful with basically learning on your own.	0
Thank you, I enjoyed this course a lot and loved analyzing the different pieces of literature	1
The last section of the course (leading up to the final) felt really rushed and as if we went over a lot of materials.	0
It was kind of hard to follow, and as a result the homeworks have seemed harder	0
