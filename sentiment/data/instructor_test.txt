Awesome Professor	1
[NAME] is very knowledgeable and obviously very enthusiastic about the subject matter and teaching the class &ndash; always a great quality to have in an instructor!	1
The only thing that bothered me was I went into office hours for help with my stylistic analysis and emailed him a rough draft, and he gave comments that I fixed, but I was missing a part of it that he didn't tell me about, so I got a bad grade on it.	0
[NAME] is a great professor.	1
She cares a lot about the subject material and her students.	1
I'm glad I made the time to go and meet her during office hours because she really motivated me to want to do well in the course.	1
Like I said, great teacher, hope to have her again sometime	1
Great teacher.	1
Amazingly enthusiastic.	1
I would undoubtedly take her class again in a smaller setting where a TA would be unnecessary.	1
